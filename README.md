## Normalization  
The objectives of standardization are the following:  
- Have stored with as little space as possible.  
- Delete duplicate data.  
- Eliminate logical errors.  
- Sorted data.  

There are several normal ways but here we are only going to do the first 3 which are:  
- First Normal Form(1FN).  
- Second Normal Form(2FN).  
- Third Normal Form(3FN).
